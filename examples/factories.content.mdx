factories
=========

Components created with MDX allow you to specify the functions used to
render each HTML element by passing a `factories` prop.

MDX provides sane defaults for your factories, so you can always use your
components without passing *any* props.

Common use cases of factories
-----------------------------

- replacing the default `<a>` element with a react-router or react-junctions
  `<Link>` element to add support for push-state navigation within MDX
  components
- augmenting the default header elements (like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) with
  links that let you navigate back to them in the future
- replacing code blocks with an editable preview
