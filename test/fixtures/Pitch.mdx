# Junctions

Add routes to your reusable components.

## The Gist

<Tab.Group>
  <Tab.Item title='Vanilla React'>
    <ComponentExample example={GistVanillaExample} />
  </Tab.Item>
  <Tab.Item title='Sugar Free'>
    <ComponentExample example={GistSugarFreeExample} />
  </Tab.Item>
</Tab.Group>

## What about react-router 4?

The main difference between junctions.js and react-router is this: **junctions puts components first, react-router puts URLs first**.

This means that if you're building an application, junctions will probably solve your problem better. And while some people are still building websites, most people are building applications.
